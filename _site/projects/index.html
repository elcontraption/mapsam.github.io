The project started with my frustration of constantly making little transparent pixels in photoshop for web backgrounds (since rgba() didn&#39;t work across all browsers). The application is built using flask and allows the user to specify HEX color value and Alpha value (transparency), which results in 1x1 pixel PNG image downloaded.</p>

The current toolset is comprised of <a href="https://github.com/svmatthews/akkordian">Akkordian</a> (a web image accordian music player), <a href="https://github.com/svmatthews/galerie">Galerie</a> (an image slider/gallery), and <a href="https://github.com/svmatthews/kino">Kino</a> (a youtube embed player - still in progress). Each of these has been my opportunity to develop quick javascript libraries for myself to use, but more to learn about modular javascript libraries. I&#39;ve enjoyed writing reusable, small-scale API&#39;s with them and have learned quite a bit about scope-oriented javascript. <em>Work In Progress</em></p>

SMAHRT are great clients and I am still making updates to this website as they produce more publications and give more presentations.</p>

<p>Another project with SMAHRT was putting together a <a href="http://smahrtresearch.com/map/">map showcasing their presentations</a> at different conferences around the world. The result allows the user to sort and explore the different presentations by date, type, and location. <em>(built with leaflet)</em></p>

        <p>This is a quick project of mine to experiment with different typefaces and see how a variety of styles can work together towards a common theme. The quote is a simple translation I ran into during work. There is a tendency to choose one or two typefaces in projects in order to keep things straightforward for the viewer. This isn’t a bad philosophy to design by. Having too many different styles can make a graphic too complex and overwhelming to the eyes.

        <p>This was a quick project for a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison needing a map for lecture purposes. It speaks for itself I suppose. Learn about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna_Process">Bologna Process</a>.</p>

        <h2>Wisconsin EDGE Project Branding
        
        </h2>
        <p><a href="http://www.wisconsinedgeproject.blogspot.com">The Wisconsin EDGE Project</a> is a student organizatio that I was Co-Director of for the 2011/2012 academic year. We had many ongoing projects that all requried some sort of design or presentation. It was our goal to give a visual identity to the organization through its design as well as through it&#39;s writing. These are some of examples of the work I put together. Besides design, I filmed and edited videos for the organization that can be seen on the edge <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/WisconsinEDGEproject">youtube page</a>.</p>
