Hi, I'm **Sam**

I'm a **web** developer and designer, a geographer with a **map** problem, and an avid **open source** contributor. I'm a 2015 Fellow with [Code for America](http://codeforamerica.org) and the lead designer & co-founder of [Situated Laboratories](http://situatedlaboratories.com).

I hack with the great people of [CUGOS](http://cugos.org) and am also an editor of the [Atlas of Design](http://atlasofdesign.org). Most of the work I do is on **[github](http://github.com/svmatthews)**.
