Hi, I'm **Sam**. Here I am on a mountain.

![mapsam on a mountain](/images/mt-walker.jpg)

I'm a **web** developer and designer, a geographer with a **map** problem, and an avid **open source** contributor. I'm a 2015 Fellow with [Code for America](http://codeforamerica.org) and the lead designer & co-founder of [Situated Laboratories](http://situatedlaboratories.com).

I hack with the great people of [CUGOS](http://cugos.org) and am also an editor of the [Atlas of Design](http://atlasofdesign.org). Most of the work I do is on **[Github](http://github.com/mapsam)**. In fact, this website is completely hosted on Github pages!

You'll find me mostly writing CSS and Javascript. I avoid server-side work when it's not necessary, but still very much like it! Here's a project, [Dropchop](https://github.com/cugos/dropchop), that I've been working on recently. It's a GIS editor completely in the browser.
