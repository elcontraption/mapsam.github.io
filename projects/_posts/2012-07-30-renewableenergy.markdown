This was my [first interactive map](http://mapsam.com/mugs/roth) (link currently doesn't work - in the middle of moving website!) that uses a javascript library "Leaflet" and data in a geoJSON format. The map focuses on useablity and dynamic code, rather than hard code that wouldn't be easily updated. Work was completed under direction of Professor Rob Roth.
