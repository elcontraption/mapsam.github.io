This is a project inspired by some client projects at work that was worth of further development since we use Instagram on website quite regularly. I consider it my first, full-scale javascript library that I've been versioning and building an API for. [The library](https://github.com/cmaseattle/instagram-grid) is simply made to grab a set of Instagram images and build a responsive grid. See the [working example](http://cmaseattle.github.io/instagram-grid/) at Creative Media Alliance's github page!
