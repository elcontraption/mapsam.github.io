I was presented the awesome opportunity to help out with the [2014 FOSS4G website](https://2014.foss4g.org) for the conference in Portland, OR. The project was completed over the course of many months with additions happening weekly.

The site took care of all presentation and workshop submissions, grant requests, and map gallery submissions.
