The [Atlas of Design](http://atlasofdesign.org/) is dedicated to showing off some of the worldâ€™s most beautiful and intriguing cartographic design. Every two years, we publish a new volume of full-color maps, selected from a worldwide competition and judged by an expert panel.

As an editor, I've had influence in all parts of the process - from collecting and organizing submissions to building the website and determining the budget for the upcoming volumes.
