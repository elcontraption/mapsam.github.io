This is a quick project of mine to experiment with different typefaces and see how a variety of styles can work together towards a common theme. The quote is a simple translation I ran into during work. There is a tendency to choose one or two typefaces in projects in order to keep things straightforward for the viewer. This isnâ€™t a bad philosophy to design by. Having too many different styles can make a graphic too complex and overwhelming to the eyes.
