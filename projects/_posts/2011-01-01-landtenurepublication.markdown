The [Land Tenure Center](http://www.nelson.wisc.edu/ltc/publications.php) of the University of Wisconsin-Madison aimed to put together a professional publication of reports and papers discussing land tenure and carbon usage around the world. I manged the full-scale publication from design concept to print. The 120+ pages required intense organization and collaboration. All maps and graphics created and edited by myself and the UW-Madison Cartography Lab.
