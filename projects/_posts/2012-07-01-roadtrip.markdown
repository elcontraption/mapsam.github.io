When I moved to Seattle I was able to make the move more of a vacation. I wanted to remember the route so I took my own coordinates on my phone and made sure to write down the events for each location. The [interactive map](http://www.mapsam.com/maps/roadtrip/) I built brings together my technical cartography skills, photography, and some simple aesthetic design.
