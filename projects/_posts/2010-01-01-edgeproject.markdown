[The Wisconsin EDGE Project](http://www.wisconsinedgeproject.blogspot.com) is a student organizatio that I was Co-Director of for the 2011/2012 academic year. We had many ongoing projects that all requried some sort of design or presentation. It was our goal to give a visual identity to the organization through its design as well as through it's writing. These are some of examples of the work I put together. Besides design, I filmed and edited videos for the organization that can be seen on the edge [youtube page](http://www.youtube.com/user/WisconsinEDGEproject).
