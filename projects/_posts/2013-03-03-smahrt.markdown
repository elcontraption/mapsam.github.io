The SMAHRTeam, Social Media and Adolescent Health Research Team, asked to have a [website](http://www.smahrtresearch.com/) put together that was made for doctors and parents alike. Designing a site for two audiences is a difficult task. The site focuses on simple navigation to information but also exploration of the information. Its design is professional and enjoyable. SMAHRT are great clients and I am still making updates to this website as they produce more publications and give more presentations.

Another project with SMAHRT was putting together a [map showcasing their presentations](http://smahrtresearch.com/map/) at different conferences around the world. The result allows the user to sort and explore the different presentations by date, type, and location. *(built with leaflet)*
